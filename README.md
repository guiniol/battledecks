This is a webapp to list and search through CardKingdom's battledecks. It is 
meant to be deployed on OpenShift.

Battledecks are cheap decks that CardKingdom makes from draft archetypes. They 
are fun and much more consistent than Wizards' Planeswalker decks. They make the 
perfect intro or casual decks.

This app was made because CardKingdom's listing cannot be easily searched and 
their text decklists means new players have to look up every card. Also, since 
the decks are regularly updated and removed, this serves as an archive.
